#Â Period window function

By using basic weather statistics (or assumptions), available python astronomy libraries, the Fressin et. al. (2013) occurrence rates compute the predicted sensitivity as a function of orbital period for a transiting survey, for example [NGTS](http://www.ngtransits.org/).

## Todo

* Include geometric probability of transit
