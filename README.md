#Â Period window function

By using basic weather statistics (or assumptions), available python astronomy libraries, the Fressin et. al. (2013) occurrence rates compute the predicted sensitivity as a function of orbital period for a transiting survey, for example [NGTS](http://www.ngtransits.org/).

## Requirements

See the included `requirements.conda.txt` and `requirements.txt` files.

## Running the code

Just type `make`, which uses [`runipy`](https://github.com/paulgb/runipy) to run the simulation on the command line. Alternatively just run the notebook!

## Todo

* The histogram should be number of detections per planet
